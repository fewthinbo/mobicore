## **Privacy Policy — Mobicore**

**Last updated:** November 6, 2025

Mobicore (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is a secure mobile application designed to enable communication and account-related functionality for users in connected game environments. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle user information, data security, and your privacy rights.

---

### **1. Information We Collect**

Mobicore does **not collect personally identifiable information** such as names, email addresses, or contact details.
User authentication and identity are handled solely within the connected game environment — Mobicore does not create or require separate user accounts.

However, to support in-app communication and related functionality, Mobicore may **temporarily store limited message data** on secure servers. This includes:

* The sender and recipient identifiers (as technical IDs, not personal data)
* The message content (encrypted)
* The timestamp of the last few messages

These records are stored **only to ensure continuity of messaging** between users and are automatically deleted after a short retention period or when no longer needed for app functionality.

### **2. Communication and Data Security**

All communication between devices and servers is **end-to-end encrypted**.
This means that only the intended sender and recipient can read the content of messages — even our servers cannot decrypt the message body.

We use industry-standard security protocols such as **SSL/TLS** to protect all data in transit and implement strong database encryption and access control mechanisms for stored data.

### **3. Data Storage and Retention**

Mobicore stores a minimal subset of recent message data on secure, access-controlled servers solely for message delivery reliability.
These records:

* Are **automatically purged after a short retention window** (e.g., when both clients have received and acknowledged delivery)
* Are **never shared with third parties**
* Are **not used for analytics or profiling**

No other user data (such as personal identity or device information) is collected or stored.

### **4. Data Deletion**

Because stored data is limited to encrypted message metadata, users cannot manually delete server data — however, all temporary records are automatically removed as part of the app’s background maintenance process.
Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored information.

If you wish to request deletion of specific data (for example, message logs associated with your technical user ID), you may contact us directly at the email provided below.

### **5. Third-Party Services**

Mobicore does **not use any third-party advertising, analytics, or tracking SDKs**.
All servers and storage systems are managed exclusively by Mobicore and are used only to provide the app’s messaging and communication services.

### **6. Children’s Privacy**

Mobicore is intended for **general audiences**.
The app does not target or knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13.
All communication content is encrypted and user-controlled.

### **7. User Rights**

Users maintain full control over their data.
If you would like to verify, update, or request deletion of information stored on our servers (such as temporary message data), please contact us using the email below.

### **8. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements.
All updates will be posted in the app or at an official communication channel.

### **9. Contact Us**

### **Summary**

Mobicore respects your privacy.
We collect **no personal identity data**, store **only minimal encrypted message data** for functionality, and never share information with third parties.
All communications are **end-to-end encrypted** and securely handled.
